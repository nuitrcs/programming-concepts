# Functions

The values you send to a function are called ____________, while the variables that are defined in a function definition are called ____________.  

The ____________ of non-keyword arguments must match the ____________ of parameters in the function definition.

In Python, ____________ arguments cannot come before ____________ arguments.  In R, it's more complicated!

You can **[ always/never ]** use the name of all of the parameters when calling a function.

It **[ is/is not ]** good practice to specify arguments in a function call in the order they appear in the function definition, regardless of whether you're using named/keyword parameters or not.

Parameters without default values in a function definition are **[ required/optional ]**.

It's **[ OK/not OK ]** to have variables in your script with the same name as function parameters.

The output of a function is called the ____________ value.


# Packages/Libraries

Packages/libraries/modules need to be ____________ before using them in every script or session.  Some are built-in, while others need to be ____________ first.

It's a **[ good/bad ]** idea to use packages written by other people.  


# Ways to Execute Code

When working interactively in the ____________, each input line starts with a ________________________, which may look like `> `, `>>> `, or `$` (or something else entirely) with a space after it.  After typing input, hit return to ____________ the code.  When the code is done executing, any output will be printed, and the command prompt will appear again at the start of a new line.  

You can also write a ____________: a file with many lines of code in it to be executed together.  They can be run from within your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio or Spyder, or from the command line.
